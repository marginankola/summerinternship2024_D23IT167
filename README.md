### web development The languages used are HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

### week-1

During the first week of the course, I delved into the fundamentals of HTML. I gained a solid understanding of basic HTML elements and learned about semantic elements, which are used to define the different parts of a web page, making the structure and content more meaningful and accessible. Furthermore, I grasped the correct approach to writing HTML code, including best practices and proper syntax. This week provided me with valuable insights into various aspects of HTML and laid a strong foundation for my web development skills. As part of my practice, I also worked on creating a blog-post page to further solidify my comprehension of the concepts.


### week-2

During week 2, I learned about the importance of CSS in webpage design. I learned how to use CSS to create attractive webpage interfaces including layouts such as float, flex, and grid. I also learned various styling techniques and applied CSS to the blog post page that I worked on during the first week. Additionally, I created other pages and components such as accordion, carousel, hero section, tables, app layout, and page number designs using CSS.

Apart from CSS, I gained knowledge about web design and web development, and their respective principles. This included understanding good and bad design, the seven different types of website personalities, typography, color rules, image handling, shadows, icons, borders, whitespace, and visual hierarchy. I also learned about creating a good user experience and website personality frameworks.

### week-3

In Week 3, I utilized the knowledge I gained in the second week to create some designs. I focused on developing a webpage for a website using grid and flex layouts. My task was to create and give the website a professional appearance by understanding its brand's startup personality, selecting suitable color schemes, incorporating relevant images, and enhancing the user interface.
